## Instructions

- [ ] Fork this repository and clone it to your `critical-web-design` folder on your machine.

#### Concept

- [ ] Develop a concept for your project by researching [math story problems](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=math+story+problems).
- [ ] Subject matter is completely up to you. For example, you could think about how you might represent your own experiences with data, numbers, software, etc.
- [ ] Consider the interface to be part of the concept, like in these [examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mQ0doWT6tGXm2W-hB5zuz3I8mijGhLSkAe_XrcfMdok/edit#gid=0): John Maeda [Money Counter](http://www.maedastudio.com/2005/moneycounter/index.php?category=all&next=exists&prev=exists&this=moneycounter), [Misspeller](http://www.maedastudio.com/2007/misspell/index.php?category=all&next=2007/human&prev=2007/reduce&this=misspell), Alexei Shulgin [Form Art](http://www.c3.hu/collection/form), Kass Schmitt and Yoz Grahame [Choose](https://bak.spc.org/choose/), or Dan Kurtz [Binky](https://www.binky.rocks/)

#### Design

- [ ] Use Figma to create a wireframe and design iterations for your project.

#### Code

- [ ] Use HTML, CSS, and JS to code your design inside `index.html`
- [ ] Use [HTML form fields](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) so users can enter different values to change the outcome of the story.
- [ ] Use Javascript variables to allow users to change the outcome of the problem.
- [ ] Use images or other media as needed in the design or form outputs.

#### Publish
- [ ] [Save and refresh](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics-keyboard-shortcuts.md#web-development-edit-save-refresh-loop) your work in the browser often to see your changes.
- [ ] Commit changes regularly.
- [ ] Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) <sup>[(?)](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-critical-web-design/blob/main/reference-sheets/css.md#css-validation)</sup>
- [ ] When finished, [push, publish, and post your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit#bookmark=id.8jryplv1i8a)
