## Introduction

Work with a partner to create a dynamic web page that performs a math story problem.


<details>
<summary>Learning Objectives</summary>

Students who complete this assignment will be able to:

- Recall how the `form`, `input`, and `select` elements work together in web forms
- Describe the difference between HTTP Request Methods `GET` and `POST`
- Compare types of form validation (client vs. server) and their purpose
- List attributes like `required`, `type`, `range`, `max`, and `pattern` used to set acceptable input values
- Implement a web framework using external scripts and a CDN
- Use HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and Git/Github to co-create a web form that computes different outputs based on user input
- Course content listed on the schedule

## Concept

Develop a concept for your project. The subject matter or questions you pose are completely up to you. Some perspectives you might consider:

- How might you represent your own experiences with data, numbers, or software?
- How do gamification strategies or other visible metrics change how you use software?
- What math, algorithmic, or other number "problem" might would you like to learn more about?
- How will the interface you create reflect your concept?

## Design

1. Use Figma to create a wireframe and design iterations for your project.
1. Include a link to your Figma designs.


## Code

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) it to your machine.
1. Use HTML, CSS, and JS to code your design inside `index.html`
1. Use [HTML form fields](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) to let users enter different values in order to change the outcome of the story.
1. Use [HTML form input attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_attributes.asp) to perform client-side validate on input values
1. Use [Javascript variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp) to allow users to change the outcome of the problem.
1. Use [Twitter Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) to style your form elements. [Experiment](https://bootswatch.com/default/) with [examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/).
1. Use images or other media as needed in the design or form outputs.
1. Display the math formula used in your project (either in the console or on the page), *after* the user submits the form.


## Publish

1. [Save and refresh](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics/keyboard-shortcuts.md#web-development-edit-save-refresh-loop) your work in the browser often to see your changes.
1. Commit changes regularly.
1. Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) <sup>([?](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-critical-web-design/blob/main/topics/html-css/css.md#css-validation))</sup>
1. When finished, push, publish, and post all deliverables to Moodle per documentation in the Assignments.
